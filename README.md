React Stream Operator
React Stream Operator is a lightweight utility library for managing and transforming data streams in React applications. It simplifies handling of real-time data, event streams, and reactive state updates — powered by the flexibility of Observables and React hooks.

Stream Operator
Operator	Description
map(fn)	Transforms each value emitted by the stream using a given function.
flatMap(fn)	Maps each value to a new stream and merges all results into a single stream.
merge(...streams)	Combines multiple streams into one, emitting values from all as they arrive.
concat(...streams)	Runs multiple streams in sequence — each starts after the previous one completes.
concatMap(fn)	Maps each value to a new stream and processes them sequentially, preserving order.
filter(fn)	Emits only the values that meet the specified condition.
